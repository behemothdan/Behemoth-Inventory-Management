				<p>Welcome to the initial release of the Behemoth Inventory Management system.</p>
				
				<p>As this is the first release of this tool designed to help you manage your inventory between the main offices, locations, and technicians, we imagine there will inevitably be a few bumps along the way.</p>
				
				<p>If you experience any errors while using this tool there are a few steps you should take. If you came across an error message on the site, please send an email to <a href="mailto:gray.daniel@gmail.com">gray.daniel@gmail.com</a> explaining what you were doing when the error occurred and, if possible, a screenshot of your browser if you can.</p>
				
				<p>If you are a manager and experience a problem with receiving an equipment shipment, please notify Joe as well as sending me an email as described above.</p>
				
				<p>If you have any questions in regards to using the website, as well as any questions about your account, feel free to send me an email. Thanks for your help in testing this initial release.</p>

						Your manager is responsible for assigning inventory to you after they receive a shipment from the main office. Be sure that if you currently have inventory that your manager remembers to assign it to you in the system. Always accurately record the equipment used in an installation as you are responsible for all equipment assigned to you.

						<p>First verify that you do not have any pending equipment transfers by clicking <a href="http://inventory.behemothdan.com/dashboard/inventory/pending">here</a> or using the menu item under Inventory. It is the responsibility to create an equipment transfer whenever they send equipment to a location. If you receive equipment without a transfer, please notify Joe. This will make sure all equipment is being accounted for. </p>
						
						<p>If you have a pending transfer, once you receive the physical items, review the quantity sent to you for each item and enter in the pending transfer form. It is important to make sure you verify the quantity so any errors when creating the transfer or when sending the equipment are resolved quickly and to prevent you from being help responsible for lost equipment.</p>
